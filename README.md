# Amazon-Reviewer
Problem -
The problems we are trying to solve are that Amazon reviews can be time-consuming,
inaccurate, and biased in determining the overall sentiment of the item for both the product
manufacturer and potential customer. Analyzing Amazon reviews can be time-consuming as products can have over 100 different reviews with a spectrum of ratings. This results in a
time-consuming process for customers in determining whether to purchase the item. Having 
a wide variety of reviews can lead to inaccuracy due to the customersâ€™ bias towards the item.
Solution -
For our project, our team (Lawrence Wong, Alexander Nguyen, and Brian Troung) have thought about creating an ai system that would be able to analyze a product's Amazon reviews to determine the overall sentiment and indicate any recurring flaws of the item. By analyzing the contents of the Amazon reviews using natural language processing and sentiment analysis we'll be able to identify significant information for both the product's manufacturer and potential customers. Our AI would be able to help the product's manufacturer by displaying the overall consensus and highlighting problems for them to improve upon. We plan to test the effectiveness of our system by comparing our AI's prediction of the consensus/review of the product with actual customer reviews.
